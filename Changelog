2.0.1 (May 5 2015):
	- fix typo

2.0.0 (May 1 2015):
	- Add support for __ne (not equals) filtering
	- Make filters default to be copies instead of operating on self, which allows them to be passed to functions but retain original value. Old behaviour can be retained doing .filterInline
	- Enhance example with more features
	- Add some docstrings
	- Fix example where __init__ did not pass args and kwargs to parent and thus broke delete
	- add asDict method for representation as a dictionary
	- Change example to use asDict to not print original data
	- Move module to a standard package setup
