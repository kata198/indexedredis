2.8.0 - (Oct 06 2015)
	- Add "connect" method to IndexedRedisModel, which allows using models
	with an alternate redis instance than that on the parent model. It returns
	a "class" that inherits the IndexedRedisModel with the
	REDIS_CONNECTION_PARAMS updated to reflect those as passed in.

2.7.2 - (Sep 24 2015)
	- Remove accidental addition of not-finished code

2.7.1 - (Sep 23 2015)
	- Updates to documentation and examples

2.7.0 - (Sep 23 2015)
	- Change very basic existing model validation to a one-time call, and
	validate on more things.
	- *EXCITING* - Implement BASE64_FIELDS on IndexedRedisModel. Any
	FIELDS that also show up in BASE64_FIELDS will be base64-encoded
	before storage and decoded upon retrieval. This makes it possible and
	very simple to use "bytes" or other binary data. You may need this,
	for example, to store files or other blobs.
	
2.6.0 - (Sep 22 2015)
	- Add copyToExternal which allows copying a model to a redis instance
	other than the one specified for that model
	- Add copyAllToExternal which allows copying the results of a filterset to
	a redis instance other than that specified for the given model
	- Fix inconsistant returns, pk should always be a string
	- Rewrote internal save function to make more sense and allow forcing
	multiple IDs
	- Add reindex method which will rerun the indexes on a list of models. Use
	this as MyModel.objects.reindex() if you add a field to INDEXED_FIELDS
	array which is already existing field to add it to indexes.

2.5.1 - (Sep 11 2015)
	- Add "exists" method for testing the existance of a primary key
	- Add MANIFEST.in file (missed in 2.5.0 -- this is only difference)
	- regen docs
	- Replace example.py with a copy of test.py... not sure why there were two

2.4.0 - (Jul 7 2015)
	- Add some more documentation
	- Cleanup connection handling
	- Remove undocumented _connection override on IndexedRedisModel
	

2.4.0 beta (unreleased to public) - (Jul 2 2015)
	- Add method, isIndexedRedisModel to see if a model extends
	IndexedRedisModel
	- Add method, hasUnsavedChanges which returns bool of if there are
	unsaved changes. Remember, you can see all (local) changes with
	getUpdatedFields
	- Implement __str__ and __repr__
	  Examples of __str__: 
	                         (Pdb) str(z)
	                         '<Song obj _id=24 at 0x7f3c6a3a4490>'
	                         (Pdb) z.artist = 'New Artist'
	                         (Pdb) str(z)
	                         '<Song obj _id=24 (Unsaved Changes) at 0x7f3c6a3a4490>'
	- Examples of __repr__ - This will build a constructor.
	eval(repr(obj)) should build the same object.
		(Pdb) print repr(song)
		Song(_id="6", album='Super Tracks', description='Super
		Nintendo', copyright='Copyright 2014 (c) Cheese Industries',
		title='Nintendo 2', artist='Mega Men', track_number='2',
		duration='1:55')
	- Implement a .copy function for copying models. Takes a single
	argument, copyPrimaryKey. If True, any saves on the copy will change
	the original model. Keep in mind this may cause sync issues. If  False
	(default) only the data is copied.
	- Implement __setstate__ and __getstate__ to make objects support
	being pickled and loaded from pickle strings efficiently.
	- Implement "reload" function on a model. This fetches any updates
	from Redis, if available, and returns a list of field names that were
	updated.



2.3.1 (Jun 27 2015)
	- Add some more docstring
	- make getNextID and peekNextID private methods. They should only be
	used internal.
	- Regenerate docs
	- Remove argument on getEncoding -- didn't do anything

2.3.0 (Jun 27 2015)
	- Change Model.objects.filter(...).delete to fetch minimal data (only
	indexed fields) instead of entire objects, so deleting is more
	efficent.
	- Add getOnlyFields, allOnlyFields, allOnlyIndexedFields, etc for
	getting partial objects
	- Increase efficency of getMultiple function
	- Add more docstrings
	- Distribute pydoc as /IndexedHtml.html 
	- Allow deleter to delete by primary key only on (Model.deleter)

2.2.2 (Jun 25 2015)
	- Fix invalid variable

2.2.1 (Jun 25 2015)
	- Implement getPrimaryKeys (get primary keys at current filter level).
	Takes optional argument to sort by age
	- Implement first/last/random for getting oldest/newest/random record
	- Update documentation a bit

2.1.1 (Jun 21 2015):
	- Allow deleting directly from a filter object
	(SomeModel.objects.filter(...).delete)

2.1.0 (Jun 21 2015):
	- Much better handle unicode in Python 2
	- allow changing encoding via a setEncoding function at the global
	IndexedRedis level

2.0.2 (May 5 2015):
	- fix typos
	- fix deleteMultiple

2.0.0 (May 1 2015):
	- Add support for __ne (not equals) filtering
	- Make filters default to be copies instead of operating on self, which allows them to be passed to functions but retain original value. Old behaviour can be retained doing .filterInline
	- Enhance example with more features
	- Add some docstrings
	- Fix example where __init__ did not pass args and kwargs to parent and thus broke delete
	- add asDict method for representation as a dictionary
	- Change example to use asDict to not print original data
	- Move module to a standard package setup
